# Melody-Snippets

Simple PoC for an automatic transcription system based on short melodic recordings.

This projects uses two approaches for tackling this problem:

1. The feature extraction/MIR approach, using the [melodia algorithm](https://github.com/justinsalamon/audio_to_midi_melodia). You can get the vamp plugin for this algorithm [here](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/melodia?p=Download%20and%20installation).
2. The machine learning approach, using the pre-trained network [CREPE: A Convolutional REpresentation for Pitch Estimation](https://github.com/marl/crepe). It can be installed with pip like a normal package.

### Backend

#### Usage

Needs the [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) installed.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
make setup-frontend
```

Then, activate the environment with:
```bash
conda activate Melody-Snippets
```

Run locally with:
```bash
make start-backend
```

#### API Reference

WIP

#### Testing the API

You can test the API locally with the following curl command:
```bash
curl -F "file=@FILENAME" localhost:5000/convert --output FILENAME.pdf
```

### Frontend

#### Usage
Needs [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Install dependencies with:
```bash
make setup-frontend
```

Run locally with:
```bash
make start-frontend
```

You can then access your app on `localhost:3000`
